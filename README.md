- ‚ö° Fun fact: **Ever since I was a kid, I was always the curious, adventurous type‚Äîconstantly asking ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and exploring how things work. I vividly remember my imaginative playtime: driving around on my parents‚Äô bed using wardrobe keys as my car keys and a book as my steering wheel, all while blasting the sounds of racing games and adventurous movies in my head. My love for cars and the roar of their engines wasn‚Äôt just about speed‚Äîit was about understanding the magic behind every mechanical marvel.
In junior high, I was the go-to person for boosting our section‚Äôs spirit during social activities like spelling bees and general knowledge contests. I thrived on connecting with people, always eager to learn from them or share my own experiences. This passion for collaboration naturally led me to the world of technology. By high school, my fascination with computers and ICT was in full swing‚ÄîI was the one diagnosing hardware issues, installing operating systems, and even fixing my elder brother‚Äôs stubborn laptop bug. I took pride in replacing my own laptop battery, upgrading RAM, and setting up devices entirely on my own.
Today, I bring that same curiosity, resilience, and creative problem-solving to my professional life. I still love to smile, explore new opportunities, and network with people. I believe that my lifelong passion for learning and innovation will help me drive impactful solutions and contribute to a dynamic, forward-thinking team.**
